Streamline team collaboration within companies through role-based access and centralized project tracking
Eliminate communication gaps between team members, managers, and administrators
Provide real-time project insights and progress tracking for all stakeholders
Ensure transparency, accountability, and productivity across teams
Key Benefits:
70% Improvement in project delivery efficiency through automated workflows
Centralized Repository for projects, tasks, and company-wide progress tracking
Real-time Status Updates for tasks and deadlines
24/7 Accessibility for remote and distributed teams
Enhanced Team Collaboration with role-based permissions and activity logs
1.2 Scope
What the System Does:
Manages multiple companies, each with their own users and projects
Provides secure user authentication and role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)
Enables creation, updating, and deletion of projects and tasks
Tracks project progress and completion status in real-time
Allows managers to assign tasks to team members

2. System Overview
2.1 Architecture Diagram
A high-level architectural representation that illustrates how different components of the Project Management System interact. It shows the relationship between frontend, backend services, and data storage layers


Architecture Layers:
Frontend (React.js): Handles UI, user interactions, and API integration.
Backend (Express.js): Manages RESTful APIs, authentication, and business logic.
Database (MongoDB): Stores project data, user info, tasks, and activity logs.


2.2 Modules/Components Description
Frontend Modules
1. Authentication Module
Handles user registration, login, and logout.
Manages JWT-based authentication and secure session handling.
Implements role-based access control (Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).
Protects private routes using authorization checks.
2. Dashboard Module
Provides an overview of ongoing projects, deadlines, and team activity.
Displays project progress, assigned tasks, and recent updates.
Offers quick navigation to important features (Tasks, Projects, Reports).
3. Project Management Module
Allows users to create, update, delete, and view projects.
Supports project details like description, members, due dates, and status.
Provides task breakdown by project and milestone tracking.
4. Task Management Module
Task creation, assignment, and tracking within projects.
Supports priority levels, due dates, and progress status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
Real-time task updates and notifications for assigned users.
5. Team & User Management Module (Admin/Manager Only)
Manage users and team assignments within projects.
Role assignment (Admin, Manager, Member).
Add or remove members and view team performance metrics.
6. Communication & Activity Module
Activity log of user actions (task updates, comments, file uploads).
In-project comments and discussions for collaboration.
Optional notifications for mentions or task updates.


7. Reporting & Analytics Module
Visual dashboards showing project progress and completion rate.
Productivity metrics per team or user.
Downloadable reports (PDF/CSV).
Backend Services
1. API Gateway Service
Acts as the central point for all API requests from the frontend.
Handles routing, load balancing, and authentication middleware.
Enforces rate limiting and security rules.
2. Authentication Service
Manages user login, signup, and token validation.
Handles password encryption and reset functionality.
Generates and verifies JWT tokens.
3. User Service
Stores and manages user profiles and roles.
Controls permissions and team assignments.
Handles user data updates and retrieval.
4. Project Service
Manages project creation, updates, and status tracking.
Handles relationships between projects and tasks.
Stores project metadata (start date, deadline, team members).


5. Task Service
Responsible for task CRUD operations and progress tracking.
Links tasks to assigned users and related projects.
Supports task prioritization and status management.
6. Report & Analytics Service
Aggregates data for performance dashboards.
Generates analytical summaries and exportable reports.

Data Storage Components
1. MongoDB Database
Primary database storing all system data.
Collections:
users — user info, roles, and permissions
projects — project details and metadata
tasks — task details, progress, and status
activities — logs of user and project actions
reports — analytics and performance summaries


2. File Storage

Throughput: The backend should support multiple concurrent users and efficiently handle CRUD operations for projects and tasks.
Security Requirements
Data Protection: All sensitive data (passwords, tokens) must be encrypted using secure hashing algorithms.
Access Control: Only authorized users can access restricted resources based on their roles.


Reliability Requirements
Availability: The system should maintain 99% uptime, ensuring consistent accessibility for users.
Data Integrity: All project and task data should remain accurate and consistent, even in case of failures.


Usability Requirements
User Experience (UX): The interface should be intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate across all devices.
Internationalization (Optional): Support for multiple languages to make the system accessible to diverse users.

6. Testing Documentation
6.1 Test Plan
Testing Strategy
Test Pyramid Approach:
Unit Tests (70%): Individual functions, React components, utility modules
Integration Tests (20%): API endpoints, database interactions, and component collaboration
E2E Tests (10%): Critical user journeys like project creation, task assignment, and reporting
Testing Scope:
All API endpoints with valid and invalid inputs
React components with various props and states
Database operations: project creation, task assignment, user roles
Authentication and authorization flows
File uploads (project documents)
Error handling and edge cases
Testing Environment
Local Development: Individual developer testing
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing on every commit
Staging Environment: Pre-production validation
Test Data Management
Factory functions for generating projects, tasks, and users
Database seeding for consistent test data
Cleanup scripts after test execution
